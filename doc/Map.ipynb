    "The map is a description of the relationships between elements of some space. In our case, it has to provide information about the intersections and the streets. We use the map to represent the relationships between the streets in a digital format. The autonomous vehicles can get the possible paths from the start point to the goal by processing the map. You can see a simple example track on the following image:\n",

    "The track need to be represented in a digital form for later processing. We used a graph based representation, where the vertexes are the some of possible robot positions on the track, the edges represent the relation between the vertexes. Our graph is an oriented graph, which has oriented relations between the vertexes. These orientation edges are shown the possible movement between two position. In general, the oriented edges are symbolized with arrow. In our case, a node (vertex) can have only eight relations, where four edges are input relations and the other four are outputs. The output relations of a node indicate the available nodes, where the robot can achieve by a single movement from the current node. The graph has role to memorize all possible movements, which are executable without crossing the marks between the lanes. So, we apply a set of data to define a node: an identification number, a coordination, an two list of edges. Later, we export these data structure into the file based on the JSON data format. So, a node will be described in same format like in the lines below:        "

The intersections of the grid represent  the vertexes in our graph. After we define the position of all nodes, we create the connection between these.
